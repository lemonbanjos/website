      <p class="text-center">
        Lemon Banjos is a small, one-at-a-time banjo shop. The terms below are meant to keep things clear
        and fair for both of us when you place an order for a new instrument.
      </p>

      <h2>Deposits</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>non-refundable $1000 deposit</strong> is required to begin any banjo build.
        This deposit reserves your spot in the schedule and allows me to purchase materials specifically
        for your instrument.
      </p>

      <h2>Approval Period &amp; Returns</h2>
      <p>
        For most “standard” builds that follow my published specifications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There is a <strong>24-hour approval period</strong> after you receive the banjo.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you decide the banjo isn’t for you within that time, you may return it in the same condition.
        </li>
        <li>
          The customer is responsible for return shipping and insurance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Custom builds</strong> (heavily customized instruments built to your specific requests)
        are <strong>not eligible for return or refund</strong>, since they are made uniquely for you.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Payment &amp; Abandoned Orders</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Once you are notified that your banjo is completed, the remaining balance is due within
          <strong>30 days</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If full payment has not been received within 30 days — and I have not heard from you to make other
          arrangements — Lemon Banjos reserves the right to <strong>resell the instrument</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The original deposit remains non-refundable and may be applied to materials, time, and storage.
        </li>
      </ul>

            <h2>Payment Methods</h2>
      <p>
        I currently accept payment by <strong>cash</strong>, <strong>check</strong>, or
        <strong>money order</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Electronic payments (credit or debit cards, PayPal, Venmo, etc.) are not accepted at this time.
      </p>


      <h2>Shipping</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Shipping and insurance costs are the responsibility of the customer unless we agree otherwise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Instruments are packed carefully, but once shipped, they are in the care of the carrier.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any shipping damage should be reported immediately so that an insurance claim can be started
          with the carrier.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Warranty</h2>
      <p>
        All new Lemon Banjos include a <strong>10-year limited warranty</strong> that covers defects in
        my workmanship. Hardware and other components not made by me are not covered under this warranty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Full details of what is and is not covered can be found on the
        <a href="warranty.html">Warranty</a> page.
      </p>

      <h2>Repairs Under Warranty</h2>
      <p>
        If a workmanship defect covered by the warranty appears during the warranty period:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You are responsible for safely packing and shipping the instrument <strong>to</strong> Lemon Banjos.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will repair the issue at no charge for labor and any parts I manufacture.
        </li>
        <li>
          I will cover the cost of shipping the repaired instrument <strong>back to you</strong>,
          unless we have agreed to something different in advance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Modifications &amp; Third-Party Work</h2>
      <p>
        Any major modification, alteration, or repair performed by a third party may affect both the
        structural integrity of the instrument and your warranty coverage. If you are considering
        significant changes, I recommend contacting me first so we can talk through the options.
      </p>

      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>
        If anything in these Terms &amp; Conditions is unclear, I’m happy to explain or talk through a
        specific situation.
