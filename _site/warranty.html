      <h1 class="section-title">10-Year Limited Warranty</h1>

      <p class="text-center">
        Every Lemon Banjo is built by hand in Glenville, West Virginia, and I stand behind my work.
        This page explains what is covered under the Lemon Banjos 10-year limited warranty, what is not covered,
        and how to request service if you ever need it.
      </p>

      <h2>What This Warranty Covers</h2>
      <p>
        This warranty covers <strong>defects in my workmanship</strong> for a period of
        <strong>ten (10) years</strong> from the original date of purchase.
        It applies to all Lemon Banjos models in the Oldtime Series, Legacy Series, Master Series, and Custom Series.
      </p>

      <p>Examples of workmanship defects include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Neck construction issues (glue joints, fretboard adhesion, neck heel fit, truss-rod channel issues)</li>
        <li>Rim construction problems (glue joints, delamination, structural wood defects)</li>
        <li>Inlays lifting or failing due to improper adhesion</li>
        <li>Binding separation caused by improper installation</li>
        <li>Finish problems that clearly result from improper application</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If a covered workmanship defect appears during the warranty period, I will—at my discretion—repair the
        instrument at no charge using new or repaired parts.
      </p>

      <h2>What This Warranty Does Not Cover</h2>
      <p>This warranty does <strong>not</strong> cover:</p>

      <h3>Normal wear, setup, and subjective factors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Tone, volume, or personal setup preferences</li>
        <li>String height, bridge selection, head tension, or action adjustments</li>
        <li>Normal fret wear</li>
        <li>Worn, scratched, or dulled finishes from everyday play</li>
        <li>Tarnishing, patina, or aging of metal hardware</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Damage from misuse or environment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Drops, impacts, or improper handling</li>
        <li>Exposure to high or low humidity, heat, cold, or rapid climate changes</li>
        <li>Improper storage or transport</li>
        <li>Water damage, mold, corrosion, or other environmental issues</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Hardware and components not made by me</h3>
      <p>
        Many components on a banjo come from reputable outside manufacturers. These parts are
        <strong>not</strong> covered under the Lemon Banjos warranty, including (but not limited to):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tuning machines</li>
        <li>Tension hoop, hooks, and nuts</li>
        <li>Flange and tone ring</li>
        <li>Armrest and tailpiece</li>
        <li>Coordinator rods and resonator hardware</li>
        <li>Banjo head and bridge</li>
        <li>Truss rod hardware (if purchased rather than custom-made)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        While the parts themselves aren’t covered, I’m usually happy to help recommend or install a replacement
        if something goes wrong.
      </p>

      <h3>Modifications or unauthorized repairs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Any repair, modification, or alteration performed by someone else</li>
        <li>Damage caused by improper repair or incorrect setup by a third party</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Any of the above may void the warranty if they affect the structure or stability of the instrument.
      </p>

      <h2>Warranty Term</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The warranty period is <strong>10 years</strong> from the original purchase date.</li>
        <li>The warranty applies to the <strong>original owner</strong>.</li>
        <li>
          The warranty does <strong>not</strong> automatically transfer if the banjo is sold. A second owner must
          contact me to discuss re-registering and any remaining coverage.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I Will Do</h2>
      <p>
        For a valid workmanship defect, I will repair the instrument at no charge for labor and for any
        parts I manufacture.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most cases, the customer is responsible for safe packing and shipping the instrument
        <strong>to</strong> Lemon Banjos. I will cover return shipping <strong>back to you</strong>
        once the repair is complete, unless we agree otherwise.
      </p>
