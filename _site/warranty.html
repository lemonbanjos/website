      <p class="text-center">
        Every Lemon Banjo is built by hand in Glenville, West Virginia, and I stand behind my work.
        This Limited Warranty explains what is covered, what is not covered, and how to request service
        if you ever need it.
      </p>

      <h2>What This Limited Warranty Covers</h2>
      <p>
        This Limited Warranty covers <strong>defects in material or workmanship</strong> under normal use
        for a period of <strong>ten (10) years</strong> from the original date of purchase.
        It applies to all Lemon Banjos models in the Oldtime Series, Legacy Series, Master Series, and Custom Series.
      </p>

      <p>Examples of covered workmanship defects include (but are not limited to):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Neck construction issues (glue joints, fretboard adhesion, neck heel fit, truss-rod channel issues)</li>
        <li>Rim construction problems (glue joints, delamination, structural wood defects)</li>
        <li>Inlays lifting or failing due to improper adhesion</li>
        <li>Binding separation caused by improper installation</li>
        <li>Finish problems that clearly result from improper application</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If a covered defect appears during the warranty period, Lemon Banjos will, at its discretion,
        repair the banjo at no charge using new or repaired parts.
      </p>

      <h2>What Will We Do to Correct the Problem?</h2>
      <p>
        Lemon Banjos will, at its discretion, repair the banjo at no charge for labor and for any parts
        manufactured by Lemon Banjos.
      </p>
      <p>
        A repaired banjo or part assumes the remaining warranty of the original banjo.
        <strong>An extension or renewal of the warranty will not be issued.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Warranty Period</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The warranty period is <strong>ten (10) years</strong> from the original date of purchase.</li>
        <li>The warranty applies to the <strong>original owner</strong>.</li>
        <li>
          If a banjo is sold second-hand and is still within the warranty period,
          the new owner must contact Lemon Banjos to discuss re-registration and any remaining coverage.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What This Limited Warranty Does Not Cover</h2>
      <p>This Limited Warranty does <strong>not</strong> cover any problem that is caused by or related to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Subjective issues of tone, volume, or setup preferences
          (including string height, bridge choice, head tension, action, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>Banjos that have been altered or modified in any way</li>

          and tarnishing or patina of metal hardware
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>

      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Although Lemon Banjos will not, under warranty, repair or replace parts damaged
        due to the above circumstances, this does not mean we cannot assist in repairing or replacing those
        parts outside of warranty.
      </p>

      <h2>Modifications and Unauthorized Repairs</h2>
      <p>
        Any repair, modification, or alteration performed by someone other than Lemon Banjos may void
        this warranty if it affects the structure, stability, or integrity of the instrument.
      </p>
      <p>
        Damage caused by improper repair or incorrect setup by a third party is not covered.
      </p>

      <h2>Shipping Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        In most cases, the customer is responsible for safe packing and shipping the instrument
        <strong>to</strong> Lemon Banjos for warranty evaluation or repair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lemon Banjos will typically cover return shipping <strong>back to you</strong> once the repair
        is complete, unless otherwise agreed upon.
      </p>
