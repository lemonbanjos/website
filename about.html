      <p style="text-align:center;">
        I'm Hunter Lemon — the builder, designer, and one-man shop behind Lemon Banjos. I started experimenting with banjo construction as a junior in high school, slowly learning the craft one attempt at a time. My first successful build was completed in May 2020, about a week after my high school graduation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center;">
        Things began moving quickly. A close friend asked me to build a custom banjo inspired by a 1954 RB-250, another asked for a conversion rim, and before long I was building instruments for players across the country — all while beginning my first semesters of college.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center;">
        Today, I continue building banjos while pursuing degrees in Computer & Information Systems and Land Surveying. No matter where I end up, banjo building is something I plan to continue for years to come.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center;">
        Lemon Banjos grew quickly because of a simple idea I’m passionate about: lightweight, no-tone-ring banjos that don’t sacrifice tone, volume, or character. My instruments are built with this philosophy in mind — classic feel, modern reliability, and meticulous attention to detail from the first cut to the final setup.
      </p>
	  <p style="text-align:center;">
        My goal is simple: to build banjos that feel alive in your hands, inspire you to play more often, and serve you for decades. I now focus exclusively on crafting complete instruments, each one built from the ground up with care, precision, and intention.
      </p>

        A Lemon has never been sweeter!
