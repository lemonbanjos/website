      Welcome to the Lemon Banjo shop journal. Here I’ll post build logs, shop updates,
      CNC adventures, and the occasional deep dive into prewar-style details.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve wanted a dedicated space to document what’s going on in the shop –
      from custom builds in progress, to experiments with materials and hardware,
      to behind-the-scenes of recording and setup work.

      If you’re interested in following along, keep an eye on this page
      or subscribe for email updates once I’ve got that wired up.
